Fluid layout Memory Match using font-awesome brand logos.

Initialize the game with `Memory.init`, which takes an optional object of options:

* `rows` [optional, default=4] is the number of rows
* `cols` [optional, default=4] is the number of columns
* `level` [optional, default=5] is the number of different symbols

`rows * cols` must be an even number or the game will throw an error.
